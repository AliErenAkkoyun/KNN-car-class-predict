# KNN-car-class-predict
In this project, the KNN algorithm can predict the class of the desired vehicle according to the information. With minor changes to the Python file, the algorithm can also predict the car price. Furthermore, you can load a 95% accuracy rate pre-trained model with the "pickle" library. Details of the settings where you can also save your own model are given in the KNN Python code.
